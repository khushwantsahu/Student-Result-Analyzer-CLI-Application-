# Student-Result-Analyzer-CLI-Application
Problem statement :- Analyzing student results manually is a time-consuming and tedious process. Calculating percentages, assigning grades, and maintaining student records by hand requires significant effort and is prone to human errors.

 Logic Statement :- The CLI system takes student marks as input, calculates the total and percentage, assigns grades based on predefined criteria, and stores the results accurately to avoid manual errors and reduce processing time.

 File Structure :- The project is implemented separately using .txt and .csv file formats. Each row represents one specific student’s data, including roll number, name, subject marks, percentage, and grade.
